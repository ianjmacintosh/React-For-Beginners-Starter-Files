# Creating our application layout with components

This lesson focuses on building the app component that houses all the child components.

Wes advocates for Prettier, it does a lot of nice dumb formatting things for you.

Start by **scaffolding out** the components that we're going to make. Although every component could theoretically be named whatever within the context of itself, matching the component name with the class name with what it's exported as (and later imported as) makes debugging a lot easier.

A snippet can make things easier, but for the lesson, typing it out by hand is decent practice.
