# Authentication

Up until this point, anyone can modify the store inventory, but we want to fix that. To do this, we first go into Firebase and set up authentication with the services we want to let users authenticate with. Each service has its own flow, but for this tutorial I'm using Facebook, Twitter, and GitHub.

Most of the "securing the room" stuff here requires understanding of the Firebase API. It's pretty easy to work with, but I think reviewing this video (or better yet, the documentation) would be required for doing work outside the tutorial.
